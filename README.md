# Idea Space LLM

A novel language model architecture inspired by diffusion models, where similar concepts occupy the same region in latent space, enabling efficient, high-speed token generation.

## Architecture Overview

The Idea Space LLM combines a structured latent space with a diffusion-based generation process:

1. **Latent Space Representation**: A continuous vector space where semantically similar concepts cluster together
2. **Encoder**: Maps input text to latent vectors 
3. **Diffusion-Based Decoder**: Generates text by iteratively refining noisy sequences
4. **Parallel Token Generation**: Unlike autoregressive models, refines all tokens simultaneously

## Key Components

- `model/`: Core model implementation
  - `encoder.py`: Transformer-based encoder implementation
  - `decoder.py`: Diffusion-based decoder 
  - `noise_process.py`: Forward and reverse noise processes
  - `idea_space_llm.py`: Complete model architecture
- `training/`: Training logic
  - `trainer.py`: Training loop implementation
  - `losses.py`: Loss functions for reconstruction and regularization
- `utils/`: Helper functions
- `examples/`: Usage examples
- `tests/`: Unit tests

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Example Usage

```python
from idea_space_llm import IdeaSpaceLLM

# Initialize model
model = IdeaSpaceLLM()

# Encode a concept to latent space
z = model.encode("The cat sat on the mat")

# Generate from latent vector
generated_text = model.generate(z, steps=10)
```

## Features

- **Semantic Clustering**: Similar concepts map to nearby points in latent space
- **Multilingual Understanding**: Same concept in different languages maps to similar vectors
- **High-Speed Generation**: Parallel token refinement for faster generation
- **Concept Manipulation**: Vector operations in latent space for concept blending
